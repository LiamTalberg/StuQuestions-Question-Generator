?L7.8: 0'00"-2'30": In order to find relations in context, how do our current systems actually understand what a dog is?

?L8.4: 0'59"-1'00": Why is the estimation of probabilities depend on the data
?L2.7: 10'07"-11'58": Do we guess the parameters at first in order to build the model? Or the model is built without knowing the parameters?

?L2.1: 4'33"-5'10": If entropy is usually non-negative, I didn't understand why are we taking a summation of negative values?

?L8.6: 3'35"-4'44": Should't design scoring function also be concerned with the context of some topics based on the country of their origin, the age group where that topic is popular, etc? How does all that dynamic information fit inside "generic statistic"?

?L2.3: 1'48"-2'22":According to the presentation the reduction entropy is actually equal, is this in terms of X given Y and Y given X or in terms of not reduced and reduced?

?L2.6: 2'05"-7'15": Can we do an analysis similar to what we did to detect Syntagmatic relations i.e. once we identify a group of words that frequently occur with each other through a syntagmatic relation, we can use that information as a basis for grouping words into terms with those appearing quite rarely with each other being related to different terms and vice versa?
